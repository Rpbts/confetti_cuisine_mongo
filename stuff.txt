npm init

When you use npm install <package>, appending --save to your command installs the package as
 a dependency for your application. Appending --global installs the package globally on your computer, 
 to be used anywhere within terminal. These command extensions, called flags, 
 have the shorthand forms -S and -g, respectively. npm uninstall <package> reverses the install action. 
 In unit 2, youâ€™ll use npm install express -S to install the Express.js framework for your project 
 and npm install express-generator -g to install the Express.js generator for use as a command-line tool.
